# foobar.withgoogle
My solutions to the Google foobar challenges.

They represent part of my journey in teaching myself coding and algorithms.
The solutions saved here are close to the 1st version that passed all the tests. ie. Little time has been spent to neaten or optimize the solutions.

My review:
Overall I've enjoyed the Google foobar problems. The early problems are straight forward, but from level 4 onwards they presented a real challange. Some of the questions have been frustrating in that the problem statement was silent/cryptic regarding certain requirements. Maybe that is a reflection on my reading comprehension. Problems which I especially found frustrating were:
- Free the bunny workers: Without hints from the internet I wouldn't have decyphered the logic behind how the keys are generated. Even with hindsight I feel that the problem statement doesn't communicate the requirements fully.
- Expanding nebula: This was a really fun challange except from the fact that malformed inputs (not all rows/columns are of equal length) is part of the hidden tests.
